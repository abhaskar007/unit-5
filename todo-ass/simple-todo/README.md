a user can type in the title
on clicking add, it should add a new task in an array of items
make a really good UI
create the following components
Todo.jsx (contains the input elements, and TodoList )
TodoList. ( accepts the data array as props, contains the TodoItem )
TodoItem.jsx (individual task)
